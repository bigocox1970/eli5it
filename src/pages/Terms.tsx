      <h2 id="credits" className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">Credit System</h2>
      <p>
        Certain features within the eli5it.app, such as document analysis and content generation, consume credits. 
        Upon subscribing to a paid plan, your account will be allocated 10,000 credits each month. 
        This is to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage for all users.
      </p>
      <p>
        Should you require more credits, you will have the option to purchase additional credits through your account dashboard. 
        Unused credits do not roll over to the next month.
